## Clickstream sample data generator

This project can simulate Clickstream events for two types of applications, a notepad Android application and a
cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web) shopping application. In addition, we support the following two usage scenarios for
these two applications:

* send the last 30 days events.
* send events in real-time.

for the first scenarios app have total 10000 users and the DAU is 1000-2000 by default, all the activities will
generate different events with different attributes according to clickstream SDK rules, finally we will generate
latest 30 day's events to your server endpoint by day.

for the second scenarios we define the app have total 100000 users and the DAU is 10000-20000, all users events
will follow the `configure.py`'s rules and be generated at once. All events will send by timer which will calculate the
last 10s events and send the events by user.

### install dependency

> pip3 install requests

### requirement

hardware: 2 vCPU 4G memory 10G disk, eg: c6a.large
network: upstream bandwidth: 3MB/s
python version: 3.8+

### Add configuration file:

Please download your `amplifyconfiguration.json` file from your web console of the solution, then copy it to the root
folder which at the same level as README file. then you can execute the following command to create and send your sample
data.

In the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file, we will only parse `appId`, `endpoint` and `isCompressEvents` three parameter
to run the program.

### how to generate last 30 days events

> python3 create_event.py

### how to generate events in real-time

> python3 create_event_real_time.py

### Other configuration

Please modify the `configure.py` to define the data size and scenario.
