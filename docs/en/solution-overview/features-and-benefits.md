The solution includes the following key features:

- **Automatic data pipeline builder**. You can easily define a data pipeline from a web-based UI console. The solution will take care of the underlying infrastructure creation, required security setup, and data integrations. Each pipeline module is built with various features and designed to be loosely-coupled, making it flexible for you to customize for specific use cases. 
- **Purposed-built SDKs**. The SDKs are optimized for collecting data from Android, iOS, and JavaScript platforms, which automatically collect common events (for example, first visit, screen view), support built-in local cache, retry, and verification mechanisms to ensure high completeness of data transmission.
- **Out-of-the-box analytics**. The solution offers built-in user life cycle dashboard (for example, acquisition, engagement, retention, and user demographic) and explorative analytics models (for example, funnel analysis, path analysis, event analysis, and retention analysis), powering various critical business analytics use cases such as user behavior analytics, marketing analytics, and product analytics.
