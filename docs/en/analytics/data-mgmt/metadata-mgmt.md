# Metadata management
The solution automatically scans clickstream data to generate metadata and then stored them in Redshift on a daily basis. There are three types of metadata:

1. **Event**: metadata describes clickstream events, which are stored in `event_metadata` table in Redshift.
2. **Event Parameter**: metadata describes clickstream event parameters.
3. **User Attribute**: metadata describes user attributes.
