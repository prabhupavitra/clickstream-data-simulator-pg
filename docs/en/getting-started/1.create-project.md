# Step 1 - Create a project

To get started with the {{ solution_name }} solution, you need to create a project in the solution console. A project is like a container that groups all the AWS resources provisioned for collecting and analyzing the clickstream data from your apps.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have deployed the {{ solution_name }} solution. If you haven't, please refer to the [deployment guide](../deployment/index.md).

## Steps
Following below steps to create a project.

1. Sign in to the **Clickstream Analytics on AWS Console**.
2. On the **Home** page, choose **Create Project**.
3. In the window that pops up, enter a project name, for example, `quickstart`.
4. (Optional) Customize the project ID that was automatically created by solution. To do so, click the `edit` icon and update the project ID as per your need.
5. Provide a description for your project, for example, `This is a demo project`.
6. Choose **Next**.
7. Provide an email address to receive notification regarding this project, for example, `email@example.com`, and choose **Next**.
7. Specify an environment type for this project. In this example, select `Dev`.
8. Choose **Create**. Wait until the project creation completed, and you will be directed to the **Projects** page.

We have completed all the steps of creating a project.
