After your application sends data (or the sample data are sent) to the pipeline, you can go into the Analytic Studio to view dashboard and query data.

## Steps

1. Log into **Clickstream Analytics on AWS Console**.
2. In the left navigation pane, click on **Analytics Studio**, a new tab should be opened in your browser.
3. In the Analytics Studio page, select the project and app you just created in the drop-down list in the top of the web page.
4. By default, you should be on the Dashboard page, if not, click on the first icon (Dashboard) in the left navigation panel.
